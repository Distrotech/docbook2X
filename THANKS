The idea of using XSLT stylesheets instead of Perl hacks for man-page and
Texinfo conversion came from Mark Burton's dbtotexi.  Many thanks.

Some parts of the stylesheets were originally copied from Norman Walsh's
DocBook XSL Stylesheets.  Of course the unadulterated XSL HTML stylesheets have
been very useful also. :) The copyright notice is in COPYING.

Michael Smith encouraged me to make docbook2X more portable.
He also expanded the roff charmaps.  I like the result.  Thank you.

Other contributors, in no particular order:

Tim Bishop has discovered a Solaris troff incompatibility
with the man pages generated by docbook2X, and helped me develop
the fix.

Craig Ruff has contributed entrytbl support for man pages
(non-trivial!).
