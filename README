docbook2X README
================

docbook2X converts DocBook documents into man pages and Texinfo
documents.

For detailed instructions on building and installing docbook2X,
see the file INSTALL (or doc/install.html).  Basically it is just 
the usual ./configure; make; make install mantra.

The documentation in HTML, Texinfo, and man-page format is found under doc/.
It is automatically generated from DocBook source, of course.  It is
distributed with the rest of the package in releases, but for CVS versions 
you must first build the package to read it.

Enjoy.
